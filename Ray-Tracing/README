For this assignment, we had to generate a 3d scene of spheres, read from an 
input file, using ray-tracing. I used Processing (http://processing.org/).
When run in the desktop version of Processing, the shading is off. However,
when the exact same files are used with Processing.js, the image appears
correctly (though with some artifacts). I'm not sure why this is.
