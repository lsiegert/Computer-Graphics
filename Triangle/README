For this assignment we had to use barycentric coordinates to create a coloured
triangle, then write the image to a ppm file. The original assignment required
us to use random coordinates for the triangle's vertices, but after turning in
the assignment I took that out so it would run faster.

I chose to use NodeBox (http://nodebox.net/)- running the file in the app will
display the image and save the ppm file in the same directory.
